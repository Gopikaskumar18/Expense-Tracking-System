 # Expense Tracking System
Full Stack Expense Management Application (FastAPI + Streamlit)

A modular, production-structured full-stack expense tracking application that allows users to manage daily expenses and visualize category-wise spending analytics.

Built using FastAPI (Backend API) and Streamlit (Frontend UI) following clean architecture principles and REST API communication.

Project Overview:

This application allows users to:

1.Add and update daily expenses

2.Categorize expenses

3.Store notes for each transaction

4.View expense breakdown by category

5.Analyze spending within a custom date range

6.Calculate percentage distribution per category

The project demonstrates clean separation between backend logic and frontend UI.

# Architecture:
Frontend: Streamlit

The user interacts with the application through the Streamlit frontend.

REST API:

Frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP REST API calls.

Backend: FastAPI

Handles business logic, processes requests from the frontend, and interacts with the database.

Database:

Stores all application data that the backend reads from and writes to.


# Flow Explanation

User interacts with Streamlit frontend.

Frontend sends HTTP requests using requests.

FastAPI backend processes the request.

Backend interacts with database through db_helper.py.

Response is returned to frontend and displayed.
